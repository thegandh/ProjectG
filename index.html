<p>
The Nehru-Gandhi-Maino family has been at the root of much of -- if not most of -- the major problems that India has suffered since independence in 1947. The truth about them has been largely hidden from public view since the government controls the media channels such the press, radio and television. Thanks to the internet, the public need not any longer be unaware of the truth. This site provides the unvarnished truth about the Nehru-Gandhi-Maino family. 
</p>
<p>
All the information on this site is from already published sources. This is merely a compilation of what others have written and what is already in the public domain. Why this site then? Because published information is a flow: facts gets published in bits and pieces, they are read by some who happen to be paying attention at that point, and then it moves out of public consciousness. The knowledge of those facts resides dispersed among various people and not as a coherent whole in any form. This site aggregates the published flow of information and presents it as a consolidated stock of information which anyone can access and learn from.
</p>
<p>
This is an information portal with the specific task of revealing the true picture of the Nehru-Gandhi-Maino family members. It is crowd-sourced: meaning that the sources of the information are the crowd of journalists, historians, academicians -- and you, the average person who is paying attention to what is going on. 
</p>
<p>
Please read, learn, understand, and disseminate the truth about that family. Hereâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/blog/821"> why. </a>
