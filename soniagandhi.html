<li> Sonia told a friend that she would rather her children begged in the streets than that Rajiv entered politics.

<li>
	. . . regarded politics as filthy, corrupt and riddled with sycophants, whom she disliked intensely. There was, after all, no shortage of them at 1 Safdarjung Road. Whether or not she ever made the comparison between her native Italy and India is not known, but there are many similarities between the Indian Congress and the Italian Christian Democrats. Both parties were in the grip of venal politicians. Both were heavily dependent on extending and receiving patronage. And then there was the link with the underworld. The Christian Democrats were linked to the Mafia. The Congress was financially in debt to its Indian counterparts. Political protectionism and its side effects were not unknown in either case.

<li>
	Letters have shown that, during the emergency, Sonia’s brother wanted a liquor contract in India for Italy. Sonia’s family was involved in business in India, so how can they say they were not interested in politics?
