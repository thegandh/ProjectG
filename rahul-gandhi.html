      <p class="lead">Thinks that Hindus pose a greater threat to India than Pakistani terrorists</p>
      <p>In response to a question U.S. Ambassador to India Timothy Roemer posed about the Pakistan-based transnational terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taibaâ€”responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attacks: "The bigger threat may be the growth of radicalized Hindu groups, which create religious tensions and political confrontations with the Muslim community."</p> {<a href="resources.html#">Source:  (Wikileaks cable)</a>}

      <p class="lead">Suffers from psychological problems</p>
      <p>In a March 1 conversation with Poloff, influential 
columnist and political insider Saeed Naqvi commented on 
Rahul Gandhi at some length.  Naqvi prefaced his remarks by noting that he was a personal friend of Rahul's father, Rajiv Gandhi, and a well-wisher of the Gandhi family.  Naqvi was initially delighted when Sonia Gandhi projected Rahul as the heir apparent, but has since lost faith.  He claims that the word among Congress insiders, including those in the coterie surrounding Sonia Gandhi, is that Rahul will never become Prime Minister for several reasons.  Saying that he "refused to indulge in gossip," Naqvi claimed that it is increasingly common knowledge that Rahul suffers from "personality problems" of an emotional or psychological nature that are severe enough to prevent him from functioning as PM.
