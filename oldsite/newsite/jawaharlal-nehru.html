      <p class="lead">Nehru did not particularly like children</p>
      <p>Nehru’s birthday is celebrated as “Children’s Day” in India because of a myth that he like children. The truth is that he had little interest in or patience with children, as Walter Crocker noted in his biography of Nehru.</p> <a href="sources.html#">Source:  </a>

      <p class="lead">Corruption by the Congress is an old phenomenon</p>
      <p>Corruption by the Congress Party is a historical phenomenon. Walter Crocker described Nehru as being caught in “a permanent dilemma.” Mark Tully wrote in a review of Crocker’s book: "The dilemmas included the need to connive at corruption to maintain the Congress in power because he was dependent on the party for his power. In internal policy Nehru felt obliged to retain imprisonment without trial although he had fiercely criticised that under the British Raj. In foreign policy he opposed any alliances or commitments to other countries but he had to accept that foreign aid would be needed for his economic plans."</p> <a href="sources.html#">Source:  </a>

      <p class="lead">Nehru made it illegal for Indians to possess gold</p>
      <p>When China invaded India, Jawaharlal Nehru used it as an excuse to sell gold bonds hoping that people would turn in their gold. When that effort failed, the government passed the Gold Control Act, which made it a crime to possess gold bars and coins.</p> <a href="sources.html#AK11">Source: AK11 </a>

      <p class="lead">Economic totalitarianism</p>
      <p>JRD Tata termed Nehru’s socialist policies as “economic totalitarianism”. He wrote: “During the past twenty years, freedom of action and the scope of operation of the private sector have been subjected to a gradual but continuous process of erosion in the course of which government has achieved a measure of control and ownership of the means of production and distribution, which would have been inconceivable to any of us if introduced all at once at the start and which is unprecedented in any country other than those under totalitarian rule.”</p> <a href="sources.html#AK11">Source: AK11 </a>
