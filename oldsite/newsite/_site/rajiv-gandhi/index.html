      <p>Yet, in the three years after 1986 that he was the Prime Minister, no papers were forthcoming from Rajiv Gandhi or Sonia Gandhi, nor were they prepared to grant me an interview. Cows are fat</p> <a href="sources.html#PJ01">Source: PJ01 </a>

      <p>[Indira after Sanjay’s death] was anxious to find something that would occupy Maneka's time and in a surge of compassion for the young widow suggested that Maneka become her secretary and travel with her. This upset Sonia. Letters were exchanged between Sonia and Indira and Indira, realizing her need for Rajiv and his family, withdrew her offer to Maneka. </p> <a href="sources.html#PJ01">Source: PJ01 </a>

      <p class="lead">Blocks researchers</p>
      <p>Owing to its obsessive concern with secrecy, the government does not allow private persons to see officials records. Even in the case of Jawaharlal Nehru, the published collected works cover only the first four years of his prime ministership. And the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library does not allow public access to the Nehru papers for the post independence period. Sonia Gandhi is the sole custodian of all records relating to Indira and Rajiv eras. So far no researcher has been allowed to consult them. </p> <a href="sources.html#SG01">Source: SG01 (Preface)</a>

      <p>D R Kartikeyan (the CBI Director) who had met her earlier (10th March 1998) told me that she had made it clear that she would soon be elected as party president but she was trying to be gracious by not hastening Kesri's exit. </p> <a href="sources.html#IG01">Source: IG01 (Page 49)</a>

      <p class="lead">Similarities between the Indian Congress and the Italian Christian Democrats</p>
      <p>. . . there are many similarities between the Indian Congress and the Italian Christian Democrats. Both parties were in the grip of venal politicians. Both were heavily dependent on extending and receiving patronage. And then there was the link with the underworld. The Christian Democrats were linked to the Mafia. The Congress was financially in debt to its Indian counterparts. Political protectionism and its side effects were not unknown in either case. </p> <a href="sources.html#TA85">Source: TA85 </a>

      <p>Letters have shown that, during the emergency, Sonia’s brother wanted a liquor contract in India for Italy. Sonia’s family was involved in business in India, so how can they say they were not interested in politics?</p> <a href="sources.html#">Source:  </a>

      <p class="lead">Italian family wealth increased dramatically</p>
      <p>However there have been growing, persistent murmurs about questionable business deals and inexplicable exponential jumps in the personal wealth of her and her family. The allegations came out in the open in 1995 when M. D. Nalapat, then Resident Editor (Delhi) of the world's largest English language newspaper, the Times of India, began a groundbreaking series of articles about Sonia.
The articles made the controversial (at the time) claim that the public docility was just a ploy, and that Sonia actually had serious political ambitions (later confirmed by her role in Congress). Also, crucially, the series said that her desire for power wasn't simply altruistic and that the wealth not only of her, but of her Italian relatives, rose stratospherically after Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister in 1984. </p> <a href="sources.html#CP11">Source: CP11 </a>

    <li>
      <p class="lead">Reluctant to change her nationality</p>
      <p>Sonia married Rajiv on 25 February, 1968. Under section 5(c) of the Indian Citizenship Act she became eligible to register herself as a citizen of India on 25 February, 1973. She chose to continue as a citizen of Italy. She applied for Indian citizenship only ten years later, on 7 April, 1983. </p> <a href="sources.html#AS99">Source: AS99 </a>
    </li>
    <br />

    <li>
      <p class="lead">Did not relinquish her Italian citizenship at first</p>
      <p>A foreigner seeking Indian citizenship has to state on oath that he or she has relinquished his or her citizenship of the original country. This requirement was all the more necessary in the case of an Italian citizen: under Italian law, an Italian taking citizenship of another country continues to retain his or her Italian citizenship. Sonia Gandhi's application did not have the requisite statement, nor did it have any official document from the appropriate authorities in Italy. The omission was made up in a curious way: the Ambassador of Italy stepped in, and wrote to the Government saying that Sonia Gandhi had indeed given up her citizenship of Italy. He did so on 27 April, 1983. Sonia got her citizenship forthwith -- on 30 April, 1983. </p> <a href="sources.html#AS99">Source: AS99 </a>
    </li>
    <br />

    <li>
      <p class="lead">Enrolled to vote in India but was still an Italian citizen</p>
      <p>Sonia became a citizen on 30 April, 1983, her name made its way to the electoral rolls as of 1 January, 1980! In response to an objection, it had to be deleted in late 1982. But sure enough, it was put back on the electoral roll as of 1 January, 1983. She hadn't even applied for citizenship till then. </p> <a href="sources.html#AS99">Source: AS99 </a>
    </li>
    <br />

    <li>
      <p class="lead">Guilty of FERA violations</p>
      <p>Maruti was one of the most odious scandals connected with Mrs Indira Gandhi and her family. The Commission of Inquiry headed by Justice A C Gupta recorded that, though she was at the time a foreigner, Sonia Gandhi secured shares in two of their family concerns: Maruti Technical Services Pvt. Ltd. (in 1970 and again in 1974), and Maruti Heavy Vehicles (in 1974). The acquisition of these shares was in contravention of the very Act that Mrs Gandhi used to such diabolic effect in persecuting her political opponents, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. </p> <a href="sources.html#AS99">Source: AS99 </a>
    </li>
    <br />

    <li>
      <p class="lead">Wealth disproportionate to income</p>
      <p>Sonia Gandhi, without having any known sources of income, has become the controller of one of the largest empires of property and patronage in Delhi. The Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Library and Museum is one of the principal institutions for research on contemporary Indian history. It is situated in and controls real estate which, because of its historical importance, cannot even be valued. The institution runs entirely on grants from the Government of India. Sonia Gandhi has absolutely no qualification that could by any stretch of imagination entitle her to head the institution: has she secured even an elementary university degree, to say nothing of having done anything that would even suggest some specialization in subjects which the institution has been set up to study. </p> <a href="sources.html#AS99">Source: AS99 </a>
