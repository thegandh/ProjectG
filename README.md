The Gandh
====

The Nehru-Gandhi-Maino family has been at the root of much of -- if not most of -- the major problems that India has suffered since independence in 1947. The truth about them has been largely hidden from public view since the government controls the media channels such the press, radio and television. Thanks to the internet, the public need not any longer be unaware of the truth. This site provides the unvarnished truth about the Nehru-Gandhi-Maino family.


All the information on this site is from already published sources. This is merely a compilation of what others have written and what is already in the public domain. Why this site then? Because published information is a flow: facts gets published in bits and pieces, they are read by some who happen to be paying attention at that point, and then it moves out of public consciousness. The knowledge of those facts resides dispersed among various people and not as a coherent whole in any form. This site aggregates the published flow of information and presents it as a consolidated stock of information which anyone can access and learn from.


This is an information portal with the specific task of revealing the true picture of the Nehru-Gandhi-Maino family members. It is crowd-sourced: meaning that the sources of the information are the crowd of journalists, historians, academicians -- and you, the average person who is paying attention to what is going on.


Please read, learn, understand, and disseminate the truth about that family. Here’s why.


The Big Picture
====

The Nehru-Gandhi family and the Congress have over the years since 1947 made major policy mistakes and personal mistakes that have cost India dearly. These mistakes have been systematically been suppressed and hidden from public view, because of which the people of India are unaware how damaging the N-G family and the Congress have been to India.


Our goal is to inform the public of these facts so that they finally throw out the N-G family and the Congress.


The culpability of the N-G family and Congress fall into two distinct classes. First are the policy mistakes which cover areas such as economics, defence, foreign relations, industrial, labor, agriculture, and so on. These have to be revealed and their negative impact concisely stated.


The other class of mistakes relate to the N-G family itself. Over the decades the dominant narrative has been that the family has been good for India. This false claim has to be revealed for the lie it is. Nehru, the patriarch, was neither wise nor well-intentioned. He was authoritarian and crude. His daughter, Indira Gandhi, demonstrated her ruthless rule during the emergency. Her son Rajiv Gandhi started off with a great deal of goodwill but soon showed that he was cut from the same corrupt cloth.


Rajiv’s Italian wife and their son Rahul are in charge of the Congress and by extension through the UPA, in charge of India. Our objective is to inform the public that these two are destroying India. They are destroying important institutions in India, striking at the very moral fabric of the country through their unprecedented public corruption in the last eight years.


Please read, learn, understand, and disseminate the truth about that family.
