    Truth ultimately prevails, as the Indian national motto declares. But for that to happen, the truth has to be known widely by Indians. The truth that is damaging to the reputation of the culprits will never be allowed to be known if they are in power precisely because if the truth comes out, they will not be in power. Indians not only deserve to know the truth, it is absolutely critical that they know it if India has to move ahead.
Indians have been told that members of the Nehru-Gandhi family – Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi – have been stellar leaders of India and that Indians owe pretty much everything to them. The fact is absolutely to the contrary. Those people have damaged India the most.

    They have been ruinous to India in every sphere. India’s desperate economic condition is directly the result of Nehruvian socialism. Indira Gandhi intensified the economic war against Indians and even introduced socialism into the constitution of India. She also laid the foundation for social divisions, taking up the task of “divide and rule” very much like the British had done.
As long as the members of the Nehru-Gandhi family continue to lead the Congress party, there is no hope for the party – and for India as long as the Congress is in power in India.
Our goal is to reveal the truth about the Nehru-Gandhi family to Indians and let them decide if they wish to give their support to the very family that has brought India to ruin.

    We believe that the truth about the blunders committed by the Nehru-Gandhi family is out there. Every bit of it has been published over the decades. However, it has not been aggregated into a form that is easily accessible to the citizens. Journalists, authors of books, academicians and researchers have this knowledge and have published it but like all information, it has been a stream that has flown past the consciousness of the people. This information should be available as a stock that is built up from the flow.
We aim to collect all this information and disseminate it for the public good. To that end, we are appealing to authors, academicians, journalists and researchers to provide us with information that they know and would like all others to know.
What all this adds up to is that these people are held in high regard by Indians – and they should not. They should not because the family continues to wield disproportionate influence on Indian politics—and therefore are holding India back.

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-12">
    We are looking for information on a variety of topics related to the Nehru-Gandhi family: personal, professional, political, etc. For instance, on the professional side for Nehru, we would focus on his limited understanding of economics and how his socialistic policies started India on the road to continued poverty. On the personal side, we know that he was authoritarian and was blind to his own ignorance. For Indira, we know that her personal life was in shambles and she had an extremely unhappy marriage. Indira was corrupt and it is reported that she did not even return the suitcases in which money was brought to her. It’s a small matter but it all adds up.
We need your help. Please tell us what you know that you want others to know regarding the Nehru-Gandhi-Maino family and the Congress party.
